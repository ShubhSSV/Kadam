                <p><strong>Season:</strong> The Kadam plant thrives in the tropical climate and is known for its seasonal blooming. It primarily blooms during the monsoon season in India, which typically spans from June to September. During this period, the Kadam tree produces fragrant, spherical yellow-orange flowers that attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies. After blooming, the tree produces fruit, which matures in the following months. While the Kadam tree can grow throughout the year in suitable climates, it is the monsoon season that marks the most vibrant and active phase of its life cycle, with flowers appearing in large clusters.</p>

                <p><strong>Region:</strong> The Kadam plant is native to tropical Asia, and it grows predominantly in countries such as India, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Myanmar. It is commonly found in tropical forests, near rivers, and in areas with abundant rainfall. The plant prefers well-drained soils and can tolerate a wide range of climatic conditions, although it thrives best in warm, humid environments. In India, it is found in various regions, including the Himalayan foothills, Western Ghats, and parts of Eastern India. Kadam trees are often planted along roadsides and in temples due to their religious significance and aesthetic value.</p>

                <p><strong>Age:</strong> The Kadam tree is known for its long lifespan and can live for several decades. Typically, the tree reaches full maturity around 10 to 15 years, but it can continue growing and producing flowers for much longer, often 30-50 years or more. Kadam trees can grow up to 30 meters in height, with a wide canopy of dense foliage. Their rapid growth in the early years makes them a popular choice for reforestation projects and afforestation initiatives. The treeâ€™s longevity and ability to grow quickly make it a valuable asset in both ecological and cultural contexts.</p>
